💓 Heart Disease Prediction App
Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application developed with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient information.
It provides a simple and interactive interface for users to input medical parameters and receive predictions in real-time.

Features
🚀 Predicts presence of heart disease with a trained machine learning model

🎛️ Scales numerical features and encodes categorical features manually inside the app

🎨 Custom Streamlit UI styling for better user experience

📈 Displays prediction probabilities clearly

Technologies Used
